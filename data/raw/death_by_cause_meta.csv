"Note ID",Note
1,"Source: Statistics Canada, Canadian Vital Statistics - Death database (CVSD)."
2,"Death refers to the permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after a live birth has taken place. Stillbirths are excluded."
3,"The geographic distribution of deaths in this table is based on the deceased's place of death and for residents of Canada only."
4,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period, (...) for figures not applicable and (x) for figures suppressed to meet the confidentiality requirements of the Statistics Act."
5,"During the production of each month's death statistics, data from previous months/years may be revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the provincial and territorial vital statistics offices."
6,"Data for the reference years 2021, 2022, and 2023, are provisional due to the shortened duration of data collection."
7,"2017 to 2023 data for Yukon are not available."
8,"Due to improvements in methodology and timeliness, the duration of data collection has been shortened compared to previous years. Fewer deaths were captured by the time of release. The 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 data are preliminary."
9,"These are provisional death counts and may not match counts from other sources, such as media reports or counts from provincial or territorial health departments and other agencies. There are additional delays in receiving the data from the provincial and territorial vital statistics offices. Differences will also occur when different definitions and collection periods are used.  "
10,"Statistics Canada’s capacity to provide useful and timely information is dependent on its ability to receive the information from the provinces and territories. For several jurisdictions this information is typically sent within 30 days of the death event, while for others it is sent 30 to 60 days, or more, following the death event. For this reason, data for certain provinces and territories for certain weeks are suppressed."
11,"These are provisional counts and subject to change. Care should be taken when making conclusions from provisional data as these counts will not include all deaths that occurred during this period, especially the most recent periods. Furthermore, deaths investigated by coroners or medical examiners, such as suicides, accidents and homicides, often require lengthy investigations. Consequently, information on the causes of death, particularly among people younger than 45, whose deaths are more likely to result in an investigation, typically requires more time before it is reported to Statistics Canada. These counts will be revised as more records are received and processed."
12,"Weeks are as defined in several epidemiological studies, including those of the United States Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC weeks start on a Sunday and end on a Saturday. They are numbered sequentially from 1 to 52 or 53 depending on the year. The first CDC week in a year ends on the first Saturday of January, provided it has at least four days in that calendar year. The first CDC week of a year may include a few days from the previous calendar year. Conversely, the first few days of a calendar year may be included in the last CDC week of the previous year. Since CDC weeks can overlap two months, they do not perfectly recreate calendar months or years."
13,"This real-time cube is designed to track changes in the death counts since their initial release. Typically, data are released as preliminary for a specific period, revised the following period based on new information and eventually revised in an annual or historical revision process."
14,"Deaths for which the date of death are missing are excluded."
15,"The counts in this table have been rounded to a neighbouring multiple of 5 to meet the confidentiality requirements of the Statistics Act."
16,"The cause of death tabulated is the underlying cause of death. This is defined as (a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury. The underlying cause is selected from the conditions listed on the medical certificate of cause of death."
17,"World Health Organization (WHO), International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10)."
18,"The causes of death list included in this table is based on the 10 leading causes of death in 2018 and COVID-19 deaths. The list for leading causes of death is based on the list that was developed and that is being used by the National Center for Health Statistics of the United States in their annual report on leading causes of death."
19,""Other causes of death" is a residual to other deaths listed in this table. "Information unavailable" is a category which includes deaths for which the medical certificate of cause of death (for Provinces and Territories sending death certificates to Statistics Canada for coding) or the underlying cause of death code (for Provinces coding causes of death) has not yet been received at Statistics Canada."
20,"Starting with the 2013 reference year, a new automated coding system was used to select the underlying cause of death. In 2017, an updated version of this coding system was implemented. For more information or to obtain documentation regarding the impact of these changes, please contact Statistics Canada's Statistical Information Service (toll-free 1-800-263-1136; 514-283-8300; STATCAN.infostats-infostats.STATCAN@Canada.ca)."
21,"The total, all causes of death and the number of deaths for which information on the causes of death is unavailable are based on the estimates presented in table 13-10-0792-01.  "
22,"The tabulation of the number of deaths for reference years 2017, 2018 and 2019 is based on the revised data released on January 24, 2022."
